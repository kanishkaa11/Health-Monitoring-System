# Health-Monitoring-System
I developed a Health Monitoring System using an IoT-based oximeter to measure and track vital health parameters such as heart rate and blood oxygen (SpOâ‚‚) levels in real time. 
The system uses the MAX30100 sensor integrated with a microcontroller to capture accurate readings, which are then processed and displayed on an LCD screen
